This repository contains the GAMS code for the prosumager model developed within the newTRENDs project.

The model describes the decision-making processes of individual households, exploring investments in building envelope renovation, appliances, equipment, onsite generation units (solar photovoltaic – PV), and battery energy storage systems (BESS). The mathematical formulation also includes the management of the hourly operations of appliances, equipment, onsite PV, and BESS. It strategically determines the optimal configuration for a household's energy system, balancing the occupants' energy demand with cost-effectiveness. The model considers bidirectional power transfer between the distribution electricity network and the household.

The model may serve as an optional add-on to the PRIMES-BuiMo (Fotiou, T., de Vita, A., & Capros, P. (2019). Economic-Engineering Modelling of the Buildings Sector to Study the Transition towards Deep Decarbonisation in the EU. Energies, 12(14). doi:10.3390/en12142745. https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/12/14/2745).
